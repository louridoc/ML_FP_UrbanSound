# ML_FP_UrbanSound
Classification of UrbanSound dataset into the 10 relevant classes using Bi-LSTM
For this project, we propose the classification of the audio-based UrbanSound8k dataset. This dataset consists of 8000 audio files that record 10 different classes of data and are based on different kinds of noises we generally find in an urban environment. It is a popular dataset for researchers to work on as it has a vast number of compact and labeled audio files, very much suitable for training.
