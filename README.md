This is the final project for the Machine Learning Class course at NYU, for professor Sundeep Rangan.  

Classification of UrbanSound dataset
For this project, we explored the classification for the audio-based UrbanSound8k dataset. This dataset consists of 8000 audio files that record 10 different classes of data and are based on different kinds of noises we generally find in an urban environment. It is a popular dataset for researchers to work on as it has a vast number of compact and labeled audio files, very much suitable for training. 

This problem does have existing solutions using CNN architectures such as:
Convolution2D, Maxpooling2D, GlobalAveragePooling 2D. Other solutions use Softmax layers, Sequential layers and Basic Dropout or Flatten and Activation layers. Here, we explored 3 different approaches to the existing ones, to evaluate the performance of the same and analyze if the accuracy can be improved. 

The approaches in this repository are:  
1. Approach 1    
2. Approach 2  
3. Approach 3  


Each notebook has its own instructions. To run the models, the dataset should be downloaded first. 

To download the dataset, you will need to fill a simple form before getting access to the dataset. You can fill it using this link:
